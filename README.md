"Computer Based Statistical & Numerical Techniques" (CBSNT) Course.

The entire course is divided in two two categories:

1) Numerical Techniques
2) Statistical Techniques.

Numerical Techniques can be explained very well from Mr. Autar video that he has explained every concepts very well with fair
examples. He has also given notes on his blog.

Statistical Techniques:

As per the Amazon reviews, I've found the "Statistics" book written by Freedman, Pisani, Purves. It has explained the statistics 
without using any mathematical terms. While I'd only read the first chapter, I've found this book interesting because the humor
is used, which has made it interesting to read this further. Even though this book has got 506 pages I'm expecting to finish this 
within a month, along with the course contents.
